Hi! I'm a person under the nickname "0&1 Plains".
I'm also only half a year into programming in Python, and a while into programming in C.
I'm currently working on
   a Python package called "zaoppp" (Zero And One Plains Python Package),
   various apps like encryptors, a chat-bots...
and all of this in Python.
In the zaoppp package, I'm creating functions like convert temperature, distance, currency etc.,
but also variables like Pi, Golden ratio, and currency values compared to euros.
